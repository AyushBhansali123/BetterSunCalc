Greetings All
SunCalc is supposed to be an improved version of a previous calculator I made.
The Warnings Suppressed in Storing.java are just warnings saying that fields can be local and a few methods are unused.
If there's any way to improve the code, feel free to tell me, because we all learn somehow. To test it, I've duplicated it on CodeHS. https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/suncalc-v3-testing-DHoVIa/run
